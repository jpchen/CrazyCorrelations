#Using Machine Learning to draw unlikely probabilities

Crazy Correlations pulls tweets posted by a user's followers in the last day and uses [indico API](https://indico.io/) to run text analysis on the tweets. It then draws likely connections to what current day event that may or may not have occurred because of said tweets.
